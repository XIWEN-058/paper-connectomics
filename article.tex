\maketitle

\begin{abstract} In this work, we propose a simple, but yet efficient,
methodologically motivated method for the problem of connectome inference in
calcium imaging data. The proposed algorithm is made of two steps. First,
processing the raw signals to detect neural peak activities. Second, inferring
the degree of association between neurons from partial correlation statistics.
This paper summarizes the methodology that led us to win the Connectomics
Challenge, proposes a simplified version of our method and finally discusses
our results with respect to other inference methods.\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

%%%%%%% !!!!!!!! \textcolor{red}{To improve (style):} !!!! %%%%%%%%
The human brain is a complex biological
organ made of 100 billions of neurons, each connected to 7000 other neurons on
average. Unfortunately, direct observations of the connectome, the wiring
diagram of the brain, is not yet technically feasible. Without being perfect,
calcium imaging currently allows the real-time and simultaneous observation of
neuron activities from thousands of neurons, producing individual time series
representing their fluorescence intensity. From these data, the connectome
inference problem consists in retrieving the synaptic connections between
neurons on the basis of the fluorescence time series. In particular, this
problem is often made difficult because of experimental issues, including
masking effects (making some of the neurons not to be observed or confounded
with others), the low sampling rate of the optical device with respect to the
neural activity speed or the slow decay of fluorescence.
%%%%%%%%%%% !!!!!!!!!!!!!! %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Formally, the connectome can be represented as a directed graph $G=(V,E)$,
where $V$ is a set of $p$ nodes, representing neurons, and $E \subseteq
\left\{(i, j) \in V \times V\right\}$ is a set of edges, representing direct
synaptic connections between neurons. Causal interactions are expressed by the
direction of edges: $(i, j) \in E$ indicates that the state of neuron $j$ might
be caused by the activity of neuron $i$. In those terms,  the connectome
inference problem is formally stated as follows:  \textit{Given the sampled
observations $\{ x^t_i \in \mathbb{R} | i \in V, t = 1, \dots, T \}$ of $p$
neurons for $T$ time intervals, the goal is to infer the set $E$ of connections in $G$.}

In this paper, we present a simplified -- yet nearly as good -- version of the
winning method\footnote{Code available at \url{https://github.com/asutera
/kaggle-connectomics}} of the Connectomics
Challenge\footnote{\url{http://connectomics.chalearn.org}}, as a simple and
theoretically grounded approach based on signal processing techniques and
partial correlation statistics. The paper is structured as follows: Section
\ref{sec:filter} describes the signal processing methods applied on fluorescent
calcium time series; Section \ref{sec:inference} then presents the proposed
approach and its theoretical properties; Section \ref{sec:results} provides an
empirical analysis and comparison with other network inference methods, while
Section \ref{sec:conclusion} finally discusses our work and provides further
research directions. Additionally, Appendix \ref{app:optimized} further
describes, in all details, our actual winning method, giving slightly better
results than the method presented in the paper at a price of significant
tuning.


\section{Signal processing} \label{sec:filter}

Under the simplifying assumption that neurons are on-off units, characterized
by short periods of intense activities, or peaks, and longer periods of
inactivity, the first part of our algorithm consists in cleaning the raw
fluorescence data. More specifically, time series are processed using standard
signal processing filters in order to remove noise due light scattering
effects, account for fluorescence  low decay and reduce the importance of
global high activity in the network. The overall process is illustrated on
Figure~\ref{fig:filtered-signal}.

% \centering

% \caption{Signal processing process for extracting peaks from the raw fluorescence data.}
% \label{fig:filtered-signal}
% \end{figure}

As the Figure~\ref{fig:original_curve} illustrates, the raw
fluorescence signal is very noisy due to light scattering artifacts that
ordinarily affects the quality of the recording~\citep{lichtman2011big}.
Accordingly, the first step of our pipeline is to smoothen the signal, using
one the following low-pass filter for filtering out high frequency noise :
\begin{align}
% symmetrical median filter
f_1(x^t_i) &= x^{t-1}_i + x^t_i + x^{t+1}_i \label{eq:symetric-median}, \\
% asymmetrical weighted median
f_2(x^t_i) &= 0.4 x^{t-3}_i + 0.6 x^{t-2}_i + 0.8 x^{t-1}_i + x_i^t,
\label{eq:weighted-asymetric-median}
\end{align}
where $f_1$ effect is shown in Figure \ref{fig:lp_curve}.

\textcolor{red}{DE: la phrase ne veut rien dire}
Considering the short delay of communication between neurons and the slow
decay of fluorescence, the second step of our pipeline consists in identifying
neuron spikes -- characterized by high frequencies -- by filtering out low
frequencies through a high-pass filter, resulting in the plot of
Figure \ref{fig:hp_curve}:
\begin{align}
g(x^{t}_{i}) &= x^{t}_i - x^{t-1}_i. \label{eq:high-pass-filter}
\end{align}

Once the low- and and high-pass filters have been applied, the remaining signal
corresponds to the finite backward difference of the fluorescence time series.
To further filter out small signal variations, mostly due to noise, the third
step consists in a  hard-threshold filter, yielding the Figure
\ref{fig:threshold_curve}:
\begin{align}
h(x^{t}_i) &= x^{t}_i \mathbb{1}(x^{t}_i \geq \tau) \text{ with } \tau > 0.
\end{align}

At this step, the processed signal only contains clean spikes. However, when a
large part of the network is firing, detecting pairwise neuron interactions is
a difficult task. Furthermore, it is even possible that neurons spike because
of a global high activity, without any actual cause (see
\cite{stetter2012model}). Accordingly, in order to reduce false interaction
detection, peak intensities at time $t$ are regularized by the global activity
of all neurons, thereby reducing the importance of peaks identified during
global high activity periods:
\begin{align}
 w(x^{t}_i) &= (x^{t}_i + 1 )^{1 + \frac{1}{\sum_{j} x^{t}_j}}.
\end{align}

In those terms, the full signal processing pipeline of our (simplified)
approach is defined by the composed function $w \cdot h \cdot g \cdot f_1$
(resp. $f_2$) and results in the plot of Figure \ref{fig:weight_curve}.


\section{Connectome inference from partial correlation statistics}
\label{sec:inference}

Let us model the fluorescence indicators of all $p$ neurons as a set of random
variables $X = \{X_1, \dots, X_p\}$ following a joint probability distribution
$P_X$. In the statistical framework, two random variables $X_i$ and $X_j$ are
said to be conditionally independent to a (possibly empty) set of controlling
random variables $Z$, denoted $X_i \perp X_j | Z$, if the joint conditional
probability distribution $P_{X_i, X_j | Z}$ factorizes into $P_{X_i|Z}
P_{X_j|Z}$. In particular, when $X_i$ and $X_j$ are conditionally independent
with respect to all the other variables, denoted $X_i \perp X_j | X^{-i,j}$,
then the observation of $X_i$ given the knowledge of $X^{-i,j}$ provides no
information about $X_j$, and vice-versa. From a graphical point of view and
assuming no hidden variable, this indicates that $X_i$ and $X_j$ do not
directly interact (i.e., $(i,j) \notin E$). By opposition, if $X_i$ and $X_j$
are conditionally dependent with respect to all other variables, denoted $X_i
\not\perp X_j | X^{-i,j}$, then the observation of one of the two variables
provides some information about the other, therefore highlighting a direct
interaction between the two random variables (i.e., $(i, j) \in E$).

Under the assumption that random variables follow a joint Gaussian
distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu; \Sigma)$ of mean vector $\mu$ and covariance
matrix $\Sigma$, $X_i$ and $X_j$ are conditionally independent with respect to
the other variables $X^{-i,j}$ if their \textit{partial correlation} statistic
is null~\citep{koller2009probabilistic}, i.e., if
\begin{equation}
\rho_{X_i, X_j | X^{-i,j}} = -\frac{\Sigma^{-1}_{ij}}{\sqrt{\Sigma^{-1}_{ii} \Sigma^{-1}_{jj}}} = 0.
\end{equation}
Conversely, $X_i$ and $X_j$ are conditionally dependent if $\rho_{X_i, X_j |
X^{-i,j}} \neq 0$, where $\rho_{X_i, X_j | X^{-i,j}}$ can now be interpreted as
the degree of association between the two variables (i.e., the larger the
value, the stronger the interaction). Note however that the partial correlation
statistic is symmetric (i.e., $\rho_{X_i, X_j | X^{-i,j}} = \rho_{X_j, X_i |
X^{-j,i}}$) and therefore does not account for the direction of the
interaction. Together, the partial correlation statistics correspond to the
inverse $\Sigma^{-1}$ of the covariance matrix, also known as the concentration
or precision matrix. Computationally, they can be estimated efficiently in
$O(M^3)$ (instead of $O(p^3)$) from the $M$ first principal components
extracted through PCA~\citep{bishop2006pattern} on the processed data. In our
experiments, $M$ is set to $0.8 p$, thereby allowing us to further filter noise
in the data.

To highlight the benefits of measuring the partial dependence conditional to
all other variables, we compare in Section~\ref{sec:results} with the
\textit{Pearson correlation} statistics, which measure instead the linear dependence
between variables, independently of the others. Accordingly, $X_i$ and $X_j$ are
independent if their Pearson correlation statistic is zero, that is if
\begin{equation}
\rho_{X_i,X_j} = \frac{\Sigma_{ij}}{\sqrt{\Sigma_{ii} \Sigma_{jj}}} = 0.
\end{equation}

Finally, let us remark that performance shows to be quite sensitive to the
choice of hyper-parameters in the signal processing pipeline (e.g., $f_1$ or
$f_2$ or the value of the threshold $\tau$). To further improve robustness, the
last step of our method therefore consists in averaging correlation statistics
over various values of the parameters, thereby reducing the variance of our
predictions. In this case, the method is referred to as \textit{Averaged
Partial correlation} statistics. Further details are provided in
Appendix~\ref{app:optimized}.

\section{Experiments} \label{sec:results}

% Datasets
To assess our method, we focus on the \textit{normal-2} dataset
provided by the organizers of the Connectomics challenge. Experiments
on \textit{normal-1, normal-3, normal-4} show similar trends to
\textit{normal-2} and are presented in the Appendix \textcolor{red}{REF}.
Those datasets have $p=1000$ time series of length $T=179500$ of image
calcium from simulated neuronal networks \citep{stetter2012model}. Those
networks have approximately 15000 edges.

% Metrics : ROC AUC and AUPRC
In supervised learning terms, the network inference task can be viewed as a
binary classification task where one has to correctly classify the presence or
the absence of edges of the graph. We assess the accuracy of the network
inference method using the area under the ROC curve (AUROC) and the area under
the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) \citep{schrynemackers2013protocols}. Since
neurons are not self-connected ($(i, i) \not \in E, \forall i \in V$) and some
inference methods could give maximal scores to those edges, e.g. Pearson
correlation, those elements are set to have minimal connectivity score prior
assessment.

The proposed approach is compared to Pearson correlation statistics (as
described in Section~\ref{sec:inference}), generalized transfer entropy (GTE)
and the GENIE3 algorithm.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{GTE} \citep{stetter2012model}, the baseline of the challenge,
measures for all pairs of neurons $i$ and $j$ the reduction of uncertainty in
predicting future values of $i$ given the observation of the time series of the
neuron $j$ conditionally to the observation of past time series of neuron $i$,
whenever the average fluorescence is over a conditioning level. Pre-processing
and conditioning level were set to reproduce baseline of the challenge.

\item \textbf{GENIE3} \citep{huynhthu2010inferring} translates the inference
of the network of $p$ neurons into $p$ supervised learning tasks. For each
task, the fluorescence of a neuron is predicted from the fluorescence of all
other neurons using a tree based ensemble such as random forest
\citep{breiman2001random}. The tree ensemble associates a variable importance
score \citep{louppe2013understanding} to each neuron used in the predictions,
which is used as a degree of associate. The following parameters are used
$10000$ trees, $\log_2{p}$ variables are randomly selected to split tree nodes
and the maximal tree depth is constrained to 1, 2 or 3. \textcolor{red}{AJ Which
depth is represented on the graph?}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Partial correlation improves over state-of-the-art methods}

Figure \ref{fig:curves} shows the ROC curve  and precision-recall curve
for correlation, GTE and partial correlation on the \textit{normal-2}
dataset. The partial correlation outperforms other state-of-the-art methods
by at least factor of 2 in AUPRC reaching $0.347$ and an increased of $0.03$ in
AUROC. Averaging Partial correlation matrix over a wide of parameters
further improves AUPRC to $0.389$ and improve AUROC by $0.009$.
Two reasons might explain such differences: (i) only the partial
correlation-based methods and GENI3 at lesser extent distinguish
direct links from indirect one, (ii) simulated networks from the
\citep{stetter2012model} generator or neural networks in general could be
reduced to a linear model after pre-processing. Those results
generalizes over the other datasets see Appendix \textcolor{red}{REF}.

\begin{figure}[bth]
\centering
\subfigure[ROC curves]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/curve_roc} \label{fig:roc_curve}}
\subfigure[Precision-recall curves]{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{images/curve_pr} \label{fig:pr_curve}}
\caption{The weighted average of partial correlation matrix, winning approach
         of the challenge, yields better than AUROC and AUPRC than all
         other state-of-the-art methods. (parameters: $\tau=0.11$ except for
         averaged partial correlation method, partial correlation used
         filter $f_1$). Area under the curves are given between $()$
         for the corresponding methods.}
\label{fig:curves}
\end{figure}

\textcolor{red}{Only one GENI3, thus it can't be observed.}
As observed on Figure \ref{fig:curves}, the GENIE3 performance increases with
deeper trees while being still computationally feasible. The reason is twofold.
First, the deeper the tree, the larger is the conditioning. \textcolor{red}{AJ:
conditioning?} As it was observed in the comparison between correlation and
partial correlation, it screens indirect links in the inferred network.
\textcolor{red}{AJ: I don't understand the link with GENIE3} Second, the number
of small trees need to be much higher than deep trees in order to observe - and
evaluate - all pairs.  However, as suggested by \cite{louppe2014understanding},
limiting the maximal depth of trees may help to improve the variable importance
computing, i.e. inferring the degree of association. \textcolor{red}{AJ: there
is no explanation of why it would be better apart for computational reason.}
Therefore a trade-off  of the maximal depth may give the best of both worlds.
\textcolor{red}{AJ:  Which tradeoff? Which worlds?}



\subsection*{Area under the ROC curve a poor metric for network inference}

The best method only infers the \textbf{undirected} network by giving the same
degree of association to both edges $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$. This is quite
surprising considering the problem statement. Trying to direct links could be
more penalizing than rewarding. For example, symmetrizing the degree of
association matrix does not necessarily degrade AUPRC and AUROC.


If the inferred network corresponds to the undirected network, it would
already yield high AUROC score for instance $\approx 0.996$ on
\textit{normal-1}. Infering edge directivity is likely to be counter-
productive or yield small gain. By contrast, the same experiment with AUPRC
would yield a score of $\approx 0.789$ on \textit{normal-1}. Thus inferring
correctly directivity would be more rewarding in AUPRC term.



% Interestingly, methods that takes into account directivity, namely GTE and
% GENIE3, improve their AUROC and AUPRC by giving the same way to directed edges.
% (in particular see GTE and GTE(undirected) in Figure \ref{fig:pr_curve}
% \textcolor{red}{AJ: Figure \ref{fig:curves}  contradicts this message,
% especially pr-curve. AS:And now?} and Table \ref{tab:tab1} in Appendix \textcolor{red}{REF}).
% Trying to detect the link direction is more penalizing than rewarding.

The area under the ROC curve is not a consistent metric with respect to the
problem statement. A clear hierarchy is also difficult to derive from ROC
curves as shown on Figure \ref{fig:roc_curve}. We advice to avoid the AUROC for
the assessment of network inference method. An alternative would be to assess
network inference using the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC).
Those conclusions are in line with \cite{schrynemackers2013protocols}.


\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusion}


% Possible extensions
% partial autocorrelation function (sometimes "partial correlation function")
% conditional independence test
% Speak about the complexity and parallelization of the methods



In this paper, we present the winning method of the Connectomics challenge. Our
approach is simple and theoretically sounded and made of two main stages: the
signal is first preprocessed with several filters and then we derive the degree
of association matrix by computing the partial correlation statistics matrix.
We also evaluate the method in a more detailed way and perform a comparison
with other inference methods. We finally discuss the relevance of the metric
used in the challenge and we point out that it was not necessary to discover
causal relationships to maximize the ROC AUC. Thus, it may be  promising to
focus on that particular topic in future works.

% In the discussion, we give hints about limiting the depth of trees in the
% GENIE3 method to infer the network. It should be interesting to see if there
% is a optimum value for the maximal depth. And of course, it may also rewarding
% to increase considerably the number of trees to get more stable predictions.

% In previous study \citep{shipley2002cause}, it has been suggested to
% consider correlation coefficients of all possible orders,
% i.e. conditioned on every subsets of the set of $p-2$ other variables. This
% would take into account multiple indirect paths between a given pair of
% variables. Instead of considering only the highest order, it may be useful to
% study with accuracy the inferred network at all orders. In this case, it may not
% be very relevant but interesting in case of dynamical networks.

% As we mentioned, in order to maximize the ROC AUC, it was not necessary to
% discover causal relationships. It may be, in future works, promising to focus
% on that particular topic.

\section{An optimized version of the algorithm to win the challenge}
\label{app:optimized}


The algorithm propose in sections \ref{sec:filter} and \ref{sec:inference} has been optimized at its extreme limit to win the challenge. In this section, we will describe the full tuned algorithm and present some results.

Note that our parameter tuning was mainly
done on the \textit{normal-1} dataset and partly on \textit{normal-4} dataset,
therefore it may justify why these networks are better retrieved despite the
fact that some might be simpler to infer.

% Introduce a custom solution to make the Y matrix asymmetric
% Introduce directivity
\textcolor{red}{Est-ce qu'on ne le ferait pas passer dans l'appendice B? Ou du moins l'Ã©quation?}
Since partial correlation is a symmetric measure, the causal mechanism behind the
interaction ($A$ directly causes $B$, $B$ directly causes $A$ or both) can not
be directly inferred\footnote{Also note that two other causal mechanisms might be
implied while having a non-zero partial coefficient: (i) a pair of variables
is induced by a common (hidden) variable; (ii) $A$ (respectively $B$) is
conditionally correlated to a hidden variable affecting $B$ (resp. $A$)
\citep{de2004discovery}.}.
In order to retrieve causal information, we developed an
heuristics based on the following observation. The rise of fluorescence
indicates the activation of a neuron $i$. If a neuron $j$ have also
an increased of fluorescence after a slight delay, this could have been
caused by the neuron $i$. Thus, we count whenever
such events occurred between consecutive time steps
\[
\hat{Z}: z_{ij} = \sum_{t=1}^{T - 1}
    \mathbb{1}(x_j^{t+1} - x_i^t \in \left[f_1, f_2 \right]) -
    \mathbb{1}(x_i^{t+1} - x_j^t \in \left[f_1, f_2 \right]), \forall i, j \in V
\]
where $f_1$ and $f_2$ are parameters of the method.
Finally, the weighted average of correlation matrices is combined with $Z$ such
that $Z$ has a contribution of $0.3\%$ to the prediction of an edge.

% For the directory method, only filters defined by Equations
% \ref{eq:low-pass}, \ref{eq:high-pass} and \ref{eq:hard-treshold-filter} were
% used.

\section{Signal processing highly improves performance}


On Table \ref{tab:tab3}, it can be seen that each step of our approach globally
improves the score on both metrics. However, processing, weights and averaging
(respectively denoted as $P$,$W$ and $Averaging$ in Tab.\ref{tab:tab3}) as
described in Section \ref{sec:filter} are the key steps of our algorithm.

It also appears that the averaging over the low-pass filter designs and the
threshold values increases significantly the quality of the inferred network
according to both metrics.

% Explaining the method (thÃ¨se de Gilles)
% Avg.: Averaging over the threholds and L-P filters improves a lot both metrics.
% Averaging

%% Depth -- Gilles chapitre 7
% Genie3 : better in auprc while worse in auroc than GTE. Why?
% Genie3 : "Conditioning" better and better but need a lot of trees
