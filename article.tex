\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

% BG : brain, complex organ

Understanding how the brain works is a key to understand and to treat
brain pathologies and disorders such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy.
Retrieving the connectomes, neurons connectivity map, will shed new lights on
the anatomical and functional connectivity of the brain.
The human brain is a complex biological organ, which is formed by 100
billions of neurons with 7000 synaptic connections on average. Inferring the
neuron connectivity network through dissection would be an impossible
and daunting task.

% Issue : we have data, but need to have to infer the connectome
Cutting edge optical devices (TODO CITE) allows to track simultaneously
the neural activity of thousands of neurons through the fluorescent
calcium indicator. From those imaging signals, the following inverse problem
is set: inferring the network connectivity from the chemical signals.

% Solution
In this paper, we describe a simple and a theoretically grounded approach
based on partial correlation to infer the neural connectivity network.
This is also the winning method of the Connectomics challenge.
