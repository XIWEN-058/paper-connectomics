Simple connectome inference from partial correlation statistics in calcium imaging
==================================================================================

Antonio Sutera, Arnaud Joly, Vincent Fran√ßois-Valet, Aaron Qiu, Gilles Louppe, Damien Ernst and Pierre Geurts.

In this work, we propose a simple, but yet efficient, method for the problem of
connectome inference in calcium imaging data. The proposed algorithm is made of
two steps. First, processing the raw signals to detect neural peak activities.
Second, inferring the degree of association between neurons from partial
correlation statistics. This paper summarizes the methodology that led us to
win the Connectomics Challenge, proposes a simplified version of our method and
finally discusses our results with respect to other inference methods.
